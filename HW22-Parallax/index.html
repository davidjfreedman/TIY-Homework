        <h1>Winnie the Pooh</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>by A.A. Milne</h4>

        <p>He took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put it back, and said:</p>

        <p>"Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?"</p>

        <p>"He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his."</p>

        <p>"But this is Me!" said Bear, very much surprised.</p>

        <p>"What sort of Me?"</p>

        <p>"Pooh Bear."</p>

        <p>"Are you sure?" said Rabbit, still more surprised.</p>

        <p>"Quite, quite sure," said Pooh.</p>

        <p>"Oh, well, then, come in."</p>

        <p>Christopher Robin nodded.</p>

        <p>"Then there's only one thing to be done," he said. "We shall have to wait for you to get thin again."</p>

        <p>"How long does getting thin take?" asked Pooh anxiously.</p>

        <p>"About a week, I should think."</p>

        <p>"But I can't stay here for a week!"</p>

        <p>"You can stay here all right, silly old Bear. It's getting you out which is so difficult."</p>

        <p>"We'll read to you," said Rabbit cheerfully. "And I hope it won't snow," he added. "And I say, old fellow, you're taking up a good deal of room in my house -- do you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse? Because, I mean, there they are -- doing nothing -- and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them."</p>

        <p>"A week!" said Pooh gloomily. "What about meals?"</p>

        <p>"I'm afraid no meals," said Christopher Robin, "because of getting thin quicker. But we will read to you."</p>

        <h2>And at the end of the week Christopher Robin said,<br> "Now!"</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="slide s3">
        <p>So he took hold of Pooh's front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher Robin, and all Rabbit's friends and relations took hold of Rabbit, and they all pulled together....</p>

        <p>And for a long time Pooh only said "Ow!" . . .</p>

        <p>And "Oh!" . . .</p>

        <p>And then, all of a sudden, he said "Pop!" just as if a cork were coming out of bottle.</p>

        <p>And Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit's friends and relations went head-over-heels backwards . . . and on the top of them came Winnie-the-Pooh -- free!</p>

        <p>So, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself. But, Christopher Robin looked after him lovingly, and said to himself, "Silly old Bear!"</p>
