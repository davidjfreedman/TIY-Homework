        <p>He took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put it back, and said:</p>

        <p>"Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?"</p>

        <p>"He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his."</p>

        <p>"But this is Me!" said Bear, very much surprised.</p>

        <p>"What sort of Me?"</p>

        <p>"Pooh Bear."</p>

        <p>"Are you sure?" said Rabbit, still more surprised.</p>

        <p>"Quite, quite sure," said Pooh.</p>

        <p>"Oh, well, then, come in."</p>

        <p>"Then there's only one thing to be done," he said. "We shall have to wait for you to get thin again."</p>

        <p>"How long does getting thin take?" asked Pooh anxiously.</p>

        <p>"About a week, I should think."</p>

        <p>"But I can't stay here for a week!"</p>

        <p>"You can stay here all right, silly old Bear. It's getting you out which is so difficult."</p>

        <p>"We'll read to you," said Rabbit cheerfully. "And I hope it won't snow," he added. "And I say, old fellow, you're taking up a good deal of room in my house -- do you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse? Because, I mean, there they are -- doing nothing -- and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them."</p>

        <p>"A week!" said Pooh gloomily. "What about meals?"</p>

        <p>"I'm afraid no meals," said Christopher Robin, "because of getting thin quicker. But we will read to you."</p>
